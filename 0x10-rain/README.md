# 0x10. Rain

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1, as if viewing the cross-section of a relief map, calculate how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.

##### <li>Prototype: def rain(walls)</li>
##### <li>walls is a list of non-negative integers.</li>
##### <li>Return: Integer indicating total amount of rainwater retained.</li>
##### <li>Assume that the ends of the list (before index 0 and after index walls[-1]) are not walls, meaning they will not retain water.</li>
##### <li>If the list is empty return 0.</li>
